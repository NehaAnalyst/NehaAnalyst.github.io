										<p><em><center><b>“Numbers don’t lie—but they do tell stories, I often say” </b> </center></em>  <br>
											<center> My name is Neha Sharma, and my journey from a 
											 commerce classroom to the dynamic world of data analytics is a tale of curiosity, reinvention, and the   
											 quiet power of persistence.</p>
										<p>Growing up, I was always fascinated by the rhythm of business—how decisions ripple  
											through organizations and shape outcomes. My Bachelor’s and Master’s in Commerce from the University of  
											Lucknow taught me to see patterns in financial statements and market trends. But it was during my  
											Google Data Analytics certification in 2025 that I had an epiphany: “Data isn’t just numbers; 
											it’s the language of progress.” Armed with SQL, Python, and visualization tools like Power BI, 
											 I realized I could bridge the gap between spreadsheets and strategy.</p>
											 <h3> My 1st Projects</h3>
										<p>My first “aha” moment came during the Google Capstone Project. Staring at 5.6 million rows of bike-share data, 
											I felt both overwhelmed and exhilarated. “What if we could turn casual riders into loyal members?” I wondered. 
											Using SQL, I unearthed trends—weekend riders lingered longer, while commuters prioritized speed.  
											My dashboards became a canvas, painting a clear picture of how tailored marketing could boost memberships.
											 The project wasn’t just about code; it was about understanding people.</p>
											 <h3> Chapter 2: From Excel Sheets to Empowering Teams</h3>
											 <p> At Aura Infusion, as a Business Analyst, I learned the art of simplicity. “Automation isn’t lazy—it’s smart,” 
												I’d tell my team. By replacing manual internship tracking with SQL-driven workflows, we slashed administrative hours 
												 and accelerated onboarding. But my proudest achievement? Designing a Power BI dashboard that aligned 
												  internship programs with organizational goals. Enrollment surged by 30%, and I saw firsthand how data could 
												   fuel human potential.</p>
											<h3>Chapter 3: The Multifaceted Freelancer – Data, Dreams, and Dusting Off Chalk</h3>
											<p>Freelancing taught me to juggle hats—sometimes three at once. By day, I’d dissect supply chain data for startups; by
												 evening, I’d tutor class 5–10 students in math and science; and late at night, I’d burn the midnight oil preparing
												  for the UPSC Civil Services exam. <b>“Life isn’t linear,” I’d remind myself, “and neither is growth.”</b>
												  One client, a small business owner, once asked, “How do you manage so many roles?” I smiled. Teaching kids algebra
												   sharpened my ability to simplify complex concepts—like explaining clustering algorithms to non-technical stakeholders. 
												   UPSC prep, with its focus on governance and socio-economic analysis, deepened my understanding of how data intersects
												    with real-world policies. And freelancing? It became my playground for experimentation. Whether building a banking
													 risk dashboard or analyzing donor trends for NGOs, I thrived on the variety.
													 There were days when pivot tables collided with history textbooks. I’d pause a Python script to help a student solve
													  there classroom problem, then return to write DAX functions for a Power BI report. The chaos had a rhythm.
													  <b> “Data teaches patience,” I’d tell my students, “and UPSC teaches grit.” </b>
													  Both skills became my secret weapons.
													  <h3>Why I Do This</h3>
													<p>To me, data is more than charts and algorithms. It’s about asking, “What’s the story here?”—and telling it with empathy.
														 My commerce roots keep me grounded in business realities, while my technical skills let me innovate. When I’m not
														  knee-deep in Kaggle datasets or polishing GitHub projects, you’ll find me scribbling insights in a journal, 
														  reminding myself: “Every dataset holds a question. My job is to find the answer.”</p>
														<h3>Let’s Write the Next Chapter Together</h3>
														<p>I’m seeking a team that values curiosity as much as results—a place where growth is mutual, and data drives
															 decisions without drowning out the human element.<b>If you’re building something meaningful, let’s connect.</b>
															  After all, the best stories are written collaboratively.</p></center>
